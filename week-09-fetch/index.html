      Daniel Dumile[a] (July 13, 1971[2] â€“ October 31, 2020), best known by his stage name MF Doom or simply Doom (both stylized in all caps), was a British-American rapper and record producer. Noted for his intricate wordplay, signature metal mask, and "supervillain" stage persona, Dumile became a major figure of underground hip hop and alternative hip hop in the 2000s.[3][4] After his death, Variety described him as one of the scene's "most celebrated, unpredictable and enigmatic figures".[5]
